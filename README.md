# 🧠 My Deep Learning Journey with fastai & PyTorch

Welcome to my personal notebook collection inspired by the brilliant book  
**[Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)** by *Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger*.

This repository documents my learning journey through hands-on, real-world deep learning projects using one of the most intuitive and powerful frameworks available today — **fastai** built on top of **PyTorch**.

## 🚀 What's This About?

As a Master's student in Applied Data Science, I believe in:
- Learning by doing
- Building intuition from first principles
- Understanding the evolution of ideas deeply and practically

This repo contains **interactive notebooks** I've run and modified on **Google Colab**, inspired by chapters in the *fastbook*. These projects are not just about replicating results — I explore, experiment, take notes, tweak, and add my own commentary for deeper understanding.

## 📘 What Does This Cover?

The notebooks in this repo span across several exciting domains:

| Domain              | Topics & Projects                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖼️ Computer Vision   | Image classification, pet breed recognition, fine-tuning CNNs |
| 🧠 NLP               | Sentiment analysis, text classification, language modeling |
| 📊 Tabular Data     | Modeling structured data, feature engineering            |
| 🤝 Recommendation   | Collaborative filtering, building recommender systems     |
| 🧮 Model Interpretation | Analyzing model decisions, ethics, explainability       |

All projects are **end-to-end**: from loading data, building models, training & validating, to deployment-ready predictions.
